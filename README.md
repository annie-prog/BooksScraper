Replace the GOOGLE_SHEETS_KEY environment variable with the path to your credentials JSON file. For detailed information on how to set up the Google Sheets, please refer to the Technical details for GSheets section. Usage Valid inputs must include at least one of the following:

b - number of books g - list of search genres s - list ordered {ascending, descending} f - list of filters d - list of keywords to search for in the description t - book title search (only one) w - list of desired book titles to search (from a given title list JSON file) Book Scraper provides several command-line options to customize your scraping experience. Here are some examples:

python main.py -b 50 -g Science -s rating ascending python main.py -b 24 -g Classics -f "rating < 3" python main.py -b 60 -g Science -f "available =14, rating < 3" -d "book" python main.py -g Science -t "Book Title" python main.py -w wanted_books.json For more detailed information on available options and usage, run:

Google Sheets API Credentials You need to have a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Sheets API for it. Follow the Google Sheets API Quickstart Guide to create a project and enable the API. Once you've enabled the Google Sheets API, you need to create credentials. Go to the Google Cloud Console, select your project, and navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials." Click on "Create credentials" and select "Service Account Key." Follow the prompts to create a service account key, choose the "Editor" role, and generate a JSON key file. Save this JSON key file securely. Rename the JSON key file to something meaningful, e.g., gsheets-credentials.json, and keep it in a secure location. Do not share this file or commit it to version control. Set the environment variable GOOGLE_SHEETS_KEY to the path of the JSON key file you generated. You can do this in your shell or by editing your project's environment variables. Usage Once you've configured the Google Sheets API credentials, you can use the Google Sheets export functionality as follows:

After scraping book data using Book Scraper, you can export the data to a Google Sheets worksheet using the GoogleSheetsHandler.write_to_worksheet(scraped_books) method. The data will be written to the Google Sheets worksheet specified in the SAMPLE_SPREADSHEET_ID variable within the GoogleSheetsHandler class. The data will overwrite any existing data in the specified worksheet. Be cautious when using this functionality to avoid data loss. Make sure that the Google Sheets API is enabled, the credentials file is correctly set in the GOOGLE_SHEETS_KEY environment variable, and your service account has the necessary permissions to write to the specified worksheet. You can customize the worksheet range and values as needed by modifying the target_range and body parameters when calling the sheet.values().update method within the write_to_worksheet function. That's it! You can now easily export scraped book data to Google Sheets using Book Scraper. Testing Book Scraper includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the correctness of its components. To run the tests, use the following command:

python -m unittest test_book_scraper.py This command will execute the test cases for the BookScraper class, ArgumentParser class, and related functionality.
